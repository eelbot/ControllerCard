#Pico Commander
The Pico Commander is a Circuit to PC interface that runs programs created by a user 
in a drag and drop style desktop application. This is my capstone project, and is currently
undergoing a major redesign. Throughout the first version of the project I learned a 
lot, and am going to improve Pico Commander in several areas to reduce cost, increase
functionality, and better the user experience.

## Version 0.1
Version 0.1 is the official release version presented as my capstone project. It
included the following functionality:
- Program creation on a PC through a drag and drop interface
- Program compilation and upload
- Program parsing and execution to control the digital I/O on the hardware module

Overall the project was a success. I bit off a little more than I could chew, and it went 
over budget, but for my first large-scale electronics project I am very happy.

## Version 0.2 (Moving Forward)
The next several releases will be different than what is currently in the
repo. Below are some of the changes that I am in the midst of planning.
- Reduce the number of digital I/O, but increase the available voltage
- Include 2 analog inputs. Low sample rate, but high accuracy
- Change microcontroller to increase energy efficiency and cost
- Plan for add-on boards
